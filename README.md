What is SetAlwaysFinish?
------------------------
SetAlwaysFinish is an Android utility app geared towards Android developers. It lets developers test whether the activities in their apps correctly process the `onSaveInstanceState` and `onRestoreInstanceState` lifecycle events. This is important because improper handling of these lifecycle events tends to result in random crashes for seemingly "unknown" reasons.

Usage
-----
1. Compile the SetAlwaysFinish app into an APK or get the pre-compiled APK from the release folder in this repository.
2. Install the APK on the device. For the install to work, you must make sure that the `Unknown Sources` checkbox is checked under `Settings > Applications`.
3. Start SetAlwaysFinish on the test device and make sure that the `Always Finish` checkbox is checked.
4. Run your app and go through every activity. Every time you create a new activity, the Android OS will unload the previous activity and trigger its `onSaveInstanceState` event. Every time you close an activity (rather than open a new activity on top of it), the Android OS will reload the activity immediately below the current activity in the activity stack and trigger its `onRestoreInstanceState` event.
5. To test the activities at the topmost level in your app's activity stack, you will need to have another external activity pop on top of them, so their `onSaveInstanceState` will trigger. The best way to do this is by launching a new app through ADB, as shown below.

    #### Get shell access via ADB
    adb shell

    #### Start the calculator application on the device
    am start -n com.android.calculator2/com.android.calculator2.Calculator

6. Once you are done testing your app, you can return to the SetAlwaysFinish app and uncheck the `Always Finish` checkbox to allow Android to optimize for speed once again.

Advanced Usage
--------------
Use the ADB shell command to launch SetAlwaysFinish, attempt to change the setting, and optionally notify the result

    $ adb shell 'am start -n "com.bricolsoftconsulting.setalwaysfinish/com.bricolsoftconsulting.setalwaysfinish.SetAlwaysFinishActivity" \
     -a "com.bricolsoftconsulting.setalwaysfinish.ACTION_SET" \
     --ez "com.bricolsoftconsulting.setalwaysfinish.EXTRA_ALWAYSFINISH" false \
     --ez "com.bricolsoftconsulting.setalwaysfinish.EXTRA_NOTIFY" true'

Uri Usage
---------
Use an Intent with the scheme `setalwaysfinish://`:

    $ adb shell 'am start -d "setalwaysfinish://?alwaysfinish=true&notify=true"'
